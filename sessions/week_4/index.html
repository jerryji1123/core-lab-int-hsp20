      	Typography is a big deal. Making the right typography choices can give your website a feel of crispness and polish. Bad typography choices, on the other hand, are distracting and tend to call attention to themselves. It’s essential to make typography readable, understandable, and legible. Typography should honor the content in a way that never adds to the user’s cognitive load.

  <h1>Working Forces</h1>
  <h1>Design Principles</h1>
  <p>Working in software development and design, we are often required to ship one-off solutions. Sometimes we’re working within time constraints and sometimes we just haven’t yet agreed upon a path forward. These one-off solutions aren’t inherently bad, but if they aren’t built upon a solid foundation, we eventually find ourselves having to pay back accrued technical and design debts.
<br>
Visual language is like any other language. Misunderstandings arise if the language is not shared and understood by everyone using it. As a product or team grows, the challenges within these modalities compound.
<br>
Design has always been largely about systems, and how to create products in a scalable and repeatable way. From Pantone colors to Philips screws, these systems enable us to manage the chaos and create better products. Digital products are perhaps the most fertile ground for implementing these systems and yet it’s not often considered a priority.
<br>
A unified design system is essential to building better and faster; better because a cohesive experience is more easily understood by our users, and faster because it gives us a common language to work with.</p>
